  <div class="about-paragraphs">
<p> 
  I grew up in the far North of South Africa, known as Limpopo Province. Studied ans obtained 2 degrees in Business management and Administration. Got enployed and served in the Public and private sector, aqcuired and learned different skills that shaped and me and made me the person i am today. 
  <br/>

  My first interest in <strong>TECH</strong> was becoming a <strong>Scrum Master</strong>. I found interest and learned skills on becoming one. I am a self taught tech "newbie" who aspires to become a programmer. Having found SheCCodes helped me start my coding journey as a frond-end developer.

  <p> I have learned a lot since starting this journey and i am happy i started, i love that we practice wnd create real time apps and pages that can be seen used by anyone. 
  <br/>
   The most interesting work i have done so far was a weather app repository that is avaliable on my <a href= "https://github.com/dashboard" target="_blank"> "GITHUB"</a> with other repositories, i have worked on.
